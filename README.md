# ViewStyle
An exploration into a functional approach to styling UIViews.

This is deliberately a playground, not a framework for direct inclusion in your project at the moment; It is an exploration (albeit one that I'm currently using in an application). 

If it's useful to you, just grab the files from the _Sources_ folder and use them directly.

Cheers,
